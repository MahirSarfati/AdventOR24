# Advent of Operations Research Challenge Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the optimization problems presented during the OR Advent challenge, found at [https://advent.bmenendez.com/](https://advent.bmenendez.com/).

**Challenge Description**

The Advent OR challenge is a series of daily optimization problems designed to enhance problem-solving skills and explore various optimization techniques. Each day presents a new challenge, covering a wide range of topics within the field of Operations Research.

**Project Structure**

This repository is organized with a folder for each day of the challenge:

* **day1, day2, ..., day25:** 
    * `problem.md`: Detailed description of the challenge for that day.
    * `model.md`: My proposed mathematical model for solving the problem.
    * (Optional) Data files, Jupyter Notebooks, or other relevant materials.

**Approach**

For each challenge, I will focus on formulating a clear and concise mathematical model. This will typically include:

* **Decision Variables:** Defining the variables that represent the decisions to be made.
* **Objective Function:** Specifying the objective to be maximized or minimized.
* **Constraints:** Defining the limitations and restrictions that must be satisfied.
